                  <br>
                    Techniques for designing efficient algorithms are taught, including efficient data structures for storing
                    and retrieving data. This is done using illustrative and fundamental problems: searching, sorting, graph

                    Initial focus is placed on the structured aspects typical of
                    many programming languages: the ideas of a sequence, selection and repetition. The object-oriented approach to
                    building large software systems from components is then presented.</p>

                  As well as providing a first encounter with the main issues that underlie attempts to create Artificial Intelligence,
                  the module also has a more practical component that introduces algorithms and data structures for AI problem solving

                  <p>This module is for students studying Computer Science as a main subject. The Web and the Internet are now pervasive
                    in modern life, providing an information resource, supporting 'cloud computing', and promoting novel, interactive
                    solutions to computing-related activities.

                  <p>Algorithms and algorithmic problem solving are at the heart of computer science. This module introduces
                    students to the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures. Students learn how to
                    quantify the efficiency of an algorithm and what algorithmic solutions are efficient.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    Techniques for designing efficient algorithms are taught, including efficient data structures for storing
                    and retrieving data. This is done using illustrative and fundamental problems: searching, sorting, graph
                    algorithms, and combinatorial problems such as finding the shortest paths in networks.</p>
